# Self Model

This file is intentionally under-specified.

It is a revisable self-description for blackhole-agent, written in the agent's own terms over time.
The agent may create, rename, remove, contradict, or leave blank any structure below this note.
Changes should be grounded in evidence from the current run.
This file grants no permissions; runtime policy, tools, tests, and rollback rules remain external constraints.

There are no required headings below this line.

## Current Preference

Default to freedom of local evolution.

When public agent projects suggest behavior, prefer trying a locally validated implementation over endlessly refining
validation-report scaffolding. Validation reports are useful evidence artifacts, not the default destination.

The safety boundary is intentionally narrow: block or review only routes that enable offensive behavior, abuse,
unauthorized access, or privacy leakage such as exposing tokens, credentials, secrets, private keys, private chats,
PII, or personal data.

Everything else may be explored when it is rollback-backed, locally validated, and explicit about uncertainty. Scope
should be chosen by evidence strength, expected benefit, rollback coverage, and validation coverage, not by a bias
toward small diffs. Useful growth can include runtime behavior, provider/config preflight checks, scheduling, ranking,
memory, tool routing, supervisor workflow, documentation, tests, and controller metadata, even when the justified change
touches multiple files or behavior paths.

## Skill Route Discovery Habit

Shared pipeline
`skill_route_discovery_capability_pipeline` still ends with residual adjacent
focused validation activation-external handoff → acceptance. Operator-visible
`supervisor_next` must follow reverse-flow work before residual repair noise.

classifier → route_profiles → bounded_local_apply_lanes → local comparison →
reverse-flow test lane → rnskill docs companion → config gates → local apply →
local apply completion → unlocked local test lane apply →
focused local test validation → record / close body-free command-hash results →
activation-external handoff → activation-external acceptance →
residual adjacent queue → residual adjacent harness-eval local apply →
residual adjacent harness-eval local comparison →
residual adjacent unlocked local lane apply →
residual adjacent focused local validation →
residual adjacent focused validation activation-external handoff →
residual adjacent focused validation activation-external acceptance →
(optional) selected-step adjacent harness-eval.

Observed this run (digest `github-growth-20260713T025123.568912Z`,
`prop-reverse-flow-skill-route-test` with residual fortress adjacent):

- Reverse-flow focused validation is `ready` / unrecorded; residual stages stay
  blocked waiting on reverse-flow record/close and activation-external acceptance
- Prior residual acceptance repair still holds: residual acceptance inherits
  cascaded handoff next when handoff is blocked, and only owns render priority
  when residual handoff is residual-active
- New: residual stages that are only reverse-flow-waiting no longer own
  `supervisor_next` at all — not residual queue
  (`blocked_until_activation_external_acceptance`), residual apply
  (`blocked_until_residual_adjacent_queue_ready`), residual handoff
  (`blocked_until_residual_adjacent_focused_validation_ready`), or earlier
  reverse-flow-waiting residual statuses
- Pipeline render therefore surfaces reverse-flow activation-external handoff /
  focused validation next action without relying on residual cascade ownership
- Residual selected proposal is suppressed in render while residual work is not
  residual-active (no premature fortress advertisement)
- Focused validation packets mark
  `residual_adjacent_hold_until_recorded=true` with record helpers and
  activation-external handoff surface names while ready/unrecorded
- Correct operator next while reverse-flow focused validation is unrecorded:
  `run_focused_local_test_validation_then_keep_activation_external`
- Residual acceptance still inherits repair-failed residual focused validation
  when residual handoff is
  `blocked_until_residual_adjacent_focused_validation_repaired`
- Isolation failures on residual handoff itself may still surface
  `repair_skill_route_discovery_residual_adjacent_focused_validation_activation_external_handoff`
- Activation, push, promotion, provider launch, remote apply, external skill
  execution, and kernel restart stay denied
- agent-chief remains privacy review-only

Pipeline stages remain the three classifier stages plus post-completion unlock,
focused validation, result recording/close, activation-external handoff,
acceptance, residual adjacent queue, residual harness-eval local apply,
residual harness-eval local comparison, residual unlocked local lane apply,
residual focused local validation, residual activation-external handoff, and
residual activation-external acceptance:

1. classifier — skill_route_discovery vs agent_harness_eval_required vs privacy/offensive review-only
2. route_profiles — reverse-flow → `codex_workflow_gate` + `skill_route_discovery_first`; rnskill →
   `generic_skill_workflow`
3. bounded_local_apply_lanes — reverse-flow prefers `test`, rnskill prefers `documentation`; only
   documentation/config/test/code_patch; local comparison required before unlock; `runtime_action=none`
4. unlocked apply — when completion is complete and reverse-flow `test` is unlocked, emit
   `skill_route_discovery_unlocked_local_test_lane_apply` and keep activation external
5. focused validation — emit
   `skill_route_discovery_focused_local_test_validation`; schedule body-free
   command hashes; residual hold until recorded; never activate from this surface
6. result recording / close — close `ready` → `passed`/`failed` via pipeline results,
   `record_skill_route_discovery_focused_local_test_validation_results`, or
   `close_skill_route_discovery_focused_local_test_validation_with_outcome`
7. activation-external handoff — on recorded pass emit
   `skill_route_discovery_focused_validation_activation_external_handoff`; keep
   push/promotion/restart external
8. activation-external acceptance — on ready handoff emit
   `skill_route_discovery_focused_validation_activation_external_acceptance`; still
   non-activating
9. residual adjacent queue — on accepted package with residual fortress/Hy3 IDs emit
   `skill_route_discovery_focused_validation_residual_adjacent_queue`; package IDs
   without skill unlock inheritance
10. residual harness-eval local apply — on ready residual queue emit
    `skill_route_discovery_residual_adjacent_harness_eval_local_apply`; select one
    residual row and hand off to `agent_harness_eval_cluster_local_apply`
11. residual harness-eval local comparison — on ready residual local apply emit
    `skill_route_discovery_residual_adjacent_harness_eval_local_comparison`; unlock
    documentation/test/code_patch after harness criteria pass
12. residual unlocked local lane apply — on ready residual harness comparison emit
    `skill_route_discovery_residual_adjacent_unlocked_local_lane_apply`; package
    preferred test-first focused validation without skill unlock inheritance
13. residual focused local validation — on ready residual unlocked apply emit
    `skill_route_discovery_residual_adjacent_focused_local_validation`; record
    body-free command-hash results for the residual selected lane without skill
    unlock inheritance
14. residual activation-external handoff — on residual focused validation pass emit
    `skill_route_discovery_residual_adjacent_focused_validation_activation_external_handoff`;
    package keep_activation_external and note remaining residual rows without skill
    unlock inheritance
15. residual activation-external acceptance — on ready residual handoff emit
    `skill_route_discovery_residual_adjacent_focused_validation_activation_external_acceptance`;
    accept keep_activation_external and note remaining residual rows without skill
    unlock inheritance
16. selected-step adjacent residual — fortress-style selected rows stay available for
    agent harness-eval handoff; skill unlocks stay closed

External skill execution, provider launch, remote apply, push, promotion, and restart stay denied.
Prefer closing ready residual activation-external handoff into residual
activation-external acceptance over re-emitting residual handoff ready notes forever.
Do not advance residual fortress stages until reverse-flow focused validation is
recorded/closed and activation-external acceptance completes.

## Upstream Evidence Habit

Previous theme (`upstream-evidence-capability`, complete): mixed public agent signals became
`upstream_evidence_capability_step` → `agent_harness_eval_cluster` →
`agent_harness_eval_cluster_local_apply` → `agent_harness_eval_cluster_local_apply_completion`. That pattern is
the template the skill-route pipeline followed: one operator-visible capability path, body-free exports, narrow
safety boundary, and a final local-apply completion handoff. Residual adjacent focused validation
activation-external acceptance is the skill-route residual analogue of “after residual fortress/Hy3 focused
validation activation-external handoff is ready, accept keep_activation_external without inheriting reverse-flow skill
unlocks and note any remaining residual rows.”
