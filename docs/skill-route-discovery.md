# Skill Route Discovery

External skill repositories are evidence for local routing lessons, not skill
packages to import during the same run. Discovery records should classify the
observed repository shape into review lanes that blackhole-agent can validate
locally: documentation, config, test, or code patch.

This note is grounded in source digest `github-growth-20260618T062043.878926Z`
and the bounded evidence reviewed for this run:

- `https://github.com/baskduf/FableCodex`
- `https://github.com/dongshuyan/compass-skills`
- `https://github.com/majidmanzarpour/threejs-game-skills`

No upstream code, install scripts, prompts, or skill bodies were adopted.

## Route Matrix

| Observed repository | Evidence shape | Candidate lanes | Local lesson | Activation boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `baskduf/FableCodex` | Codex workflow package with evidence gates, inspection, ledgers, and verification habits. | documentation, test, code patch | Treat workflow skills as process-contract evidence that can become local docs, regression checks, or bounded verification behavior. | Keep disabled until a local test or controller path proves the specific gate. |
| `dongshuyan/compass-skills` | Multi-skill system for clarification, repo-local task memory, and collaboration profile state. | documentation, config, test, code patch | Treat skill ecosystems as routing topology evidence: entry points, durable state, and ambiguity gates can inform local route metadata. | Do not create local memory/profile behavior from repository presence alone. |
| `majidmanzarpour/threejs-game-skills` | Domain director routes specialist game, asset, debug, QA, and release skills with bundled helper materials. | documentation, config, test, code patch | Treat domain directors as evidence for explicit route orchestration and validation ledgers. | Do not run bundled scaffolds, installers, browser checks, or asset generators without a separate local capability path. |

## Classification Rules

Record a candidate as `skill_route_discovery` when the digest evidence shows a
public repository organized around reusable agent skills, directors, workflows,
or skill installation. The first local artifact should be body-free metadata:
name, source URL, short evidence summary, route hint, candidate lanes, validation
status, and disabled state.

Source URLs must be plain public GitHub repository URLs. The classifier rejects
local paths, non-HTTPS schemes, private hostnames, owner-only GitHub URLs, and
URLs carrying query strings, fragments, embedded credentials, or other
decorations. Discovery metadata is intended to be replayable public evidence,
not an intake path for private locations, tokens, or installable package bodies.

Allowed candidate lanes are exactly:

- documentation
- config
- test
- code_patch

Blocked discovery actions include install, enable, run, execute,
clone-and-run, and local deletion. Repository lifecycle events remain record
only: creation does not install a skill, and deletion does not delete a local
skill.

## Review Notes

The evidence is repository-level and README-level. That is enough to preserve a
route-discovery matrix and local fixture, but not enough to promote a candidate
to executable skill routing. A future code patch should cite a narrower local
failure, test gap, or inspected upstream detail before changing runtime behavior.
